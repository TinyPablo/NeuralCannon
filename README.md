# 🎯 Neural Cannon

A simple Unity project demonstrating a **single neuron (no bias)** learning the relationship between cannon power and projectile distance.  
It helps to **intuitively understand the basics of neural networks** through visual, interactive learning.  
Includes a firing simulation, live training, and real-time graph visualization.

---

## 🧠 How It Works
- The cannon fires projectiles with different power levels.  
- A single neuron predicts the distance based on power.  
- After each shot, the neuron adjusts its weight to improve accuracy.  
- The graph updates in real time to visualize learning progress.
